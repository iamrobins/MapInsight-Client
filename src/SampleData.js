There is also a chicken version. Shake Tataki: my favorite is the beef one.\n\nSeaweed salad is different from typical salad options. I recommend you try it.\n\nTuna tartar bites are a must-try. Its presentation with flatbread is very unique, and the taste is amazing.\n\nMy favorite is Hotate Kataifi: seafood wrapped in kataifi and served hot with a mayonnaise-like sauce. Everyone I've recommended it to has rated it 10 out of 10.\n\nThere are 3 types of Edamame options. All are very good. I recommend the grilled one.\n\nFor crab lovers, Kani Korokke is a must-try: perfectly bite-sized round flavor balls.\n\nI won't comment on the sushi as that's your preference, but I've tried most of them, and they are very tasty.\n\nI recommend you try jasmine tea; it soothes your stomach.\n\nThe ambiance is great. It’s a very busy branch. In terms of visuals, the Shoreditch branch is my favorite, but I always enjoy going to the Covent Garden branch in the evening. I recommend booking for the evening hours.\n\nAs for cleanliness, the restrooms are downstairs and always clean.\n\nIn every aspect, it’s stellar⭐\n\nZAY",

The starters were excellent - miso soup was an absolute umami bomb and the tempura was incredibly light, the prawns cooked so they're almost creamy. Perfect takoyaki, and the butakakuni was fabulous. We got a little seared o-toro and a scallop and those were both delicious as well. The service was also great, and the restaurant was nice and quiet. I'm excited to come back, it was really delicious and the menu is massive. Literally everything we got was perfect, there's lots I'm excited to try out. My new favorite local spot. Go here!!!",

We didn’t book a table and it was very busy, but were lucky, as we didn’t have to wait for a table.\n\nThe food is amazing as always. And the staff are very friendly there. There is also always someone walking around with a jug of water to top up your glass of water 💧.\n\nThey do have lovely cocktails 🍹 there. This dragon 🐉 cocktail that I had was delicious, but since I’m Asian, I’m quite a light weight 😳.\n\nWe didn’t finish our food, so we asked for a takeaway box. The waitress who served us, put all the food in the box and a bag for us.\n\nSome may say the food is pricey there, but for the quality it is totally worth it! I highly recommend Dozo sushi 🍣 if you are in London and fancy sushi for lunch or dinner 😊',

The sushi was only OK - very normal, nothing more than rice and fish.\nThe quail was nice but nothing extraordinary.\n\nThe sea bas, on the other hand, was amazing. Juicy, very well grilled, with a great lemon like sauce, and beautifully served.\n\nThe service was amazing.\n\nBut eventually, the price was too high for what we got.",

The sushi was only OK - very normal, nothing more than rice and fish.\nThe quail was nice but nothing extraordinary.\n\nThe sea bas, on the other hand, was amazing. Juicy, very well grilled, with a great lemon like sauce, and beautifully served.\n\nThe service was amazing.\n\nBut eventually, the price was too high for what we got.",

We booked a reservation to be seated at the bar so we could watch the chefs prepare the dishes which I would recommend if you’re like us and love to watch. The price is a bit high which is reflected by the high quality fish. I would still totally visit again as I still want to try more of their menu. The staff were lovely and I love the wooden interiors inside. Such a beautiful restaurant. I’ll be back soon hopefully!',

You can  do both on the same table. The food was so good. The sushi course is unlimited so you can ask them for your favourite as many times as you can handle. The drinks are free flowing - they do keep you topped up and you can change between the 3 choices. The only complaint I had about the place was the noise levels - both from the DJ and the other guests. We did ask them to turn down the music slightly so that people wouldn't feel the need to shout above the music. They did try to turn down the music slightly but I guess with a live DJ this can be difficult. An overall enjoyable experience. I would go again, but probably ask to be seated as far away from the speakers as possible.",

I have allergies and she was very intentional about double checking meals for me. Rock shrimp was amazing so fresh and soft. Loved all the food except the lamb culets (very small) and cod gyoza just didn't wow me in the way I hoped.

Also we ordered the crispy prawn bao buns, which were also amazingly delicious! We didn’t know the restaurant did discounts for NHS staff but as the staff member who was giving us the bill was talking to us, we stated that we work for the NHS, he immediately told us we can get NHS discount and that if he knew we would’ve put it on our bill earlier.
